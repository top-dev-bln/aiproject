 * delivery pipeline. The ingress itself is transport-agnostic: it does not
 * deal with HTTP details and is responsible only for forwarding updates
 * into the system.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #handle(Update)} is expected to be non-blocking or
 * fast-returning. Any interruption or backpressure handling should be
 * performed inside the implementation.
