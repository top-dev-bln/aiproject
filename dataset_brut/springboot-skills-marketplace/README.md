# Spring Boot Skills Marketplace

Claude Code skills that help you build Spring Boot apps with architecture that actually fits your needs.

## Why This Exists

Projects that start simple tend to grow messy. These skills help you pick the right architecture for where you are now—with a clear path forward when things get complex.

> **Start simple. Add complexity only when complexity demands it.**

Built on patterns from [spring-boot-application-architecture-patterns](https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/spring-boot-application-architecture-patterns).

## Architecture Patterns (Progressive)

| Pattern | Complexity | When to Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Layered** | ⭐ Low | Simple CRUD, prototypes, MVPs |
| **Package-by-Module** | ⭐⭐ Low-Medium | 3-5 distinct features, medium apps |
| **Modular Monolith** | ⭐⭐ Medium | Need module boundaries, Spring Modulith |
| **Tomato** | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium-High | Rich domain, Value Objects, type safety |
| **DDD+Hexagonal** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Complex domains, CQRS, infra independence |

### Claude Code (Manual Installation)

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone https://github.com/a-pavithraa/springboot-skills-marketplace.git

# Copy skills to Claude Code skills directory
cp -r springboot-skills-marketplace/plugins/springboot-architecture/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Codex (Manual Installation)

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone https://github.com/a-pavithraa/springboot-skills-marketplace.git

# Copy skills to Codex skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -r springboot-skills-marketplace/plugins/springboot-architecture/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/
```

## Usage

### Claude Code

Skills are automatically discovered and loaded when relevant. Claude will invoke them based on your request:

```
You: "I need to create a new Spring Boot microservice"
Claude: [Automatically loads creating-springboot-projects skill]
```

You can also explicitly request a skill:
```
You: "Use the spring-data-jpa skill to optimize this repository"
```

### Codex

Skills must be manually invoked using the `$skill-name` syntax:

```
using $creating-springboot-projects create a new order service
using $spring-data-jpa optimize this repository code
using $springboot-migration upgrade to Spring Boot 4
using $code-reviewer review this service implementation
```

For detailed reference chapters, include the path:
```
using $spring-data-jpa and ~/.codex/skills/spring-data-jpa/references/dto-projections.md implement efficient queries
```

## Available Skills

### creating-springboot-projects

Asks a few questions about your project, then builds the right architecture from the start.

What you get: assessment-driven scaffolding, Spring Initializr setup, and templates for Value Objects, Rich Entities, CQRS patterns, converters—whatever your chosen architecture needs.

**Quick assessment covers:**
- Domain complexity (CRUD vs. business rules)
- Team size and project lifespan
- Type safety requirements
- Bounded contexts

### spring-data-jpa

Helps you write JPA code that doesn't slow down six months later.

Covers query patterns, DTO projections, custom repositories, CQRS query services, and the performance anti-patterns that bite everyone eventually (repositories for every entity, method-name query hell, blind `save()` calls).

### springboot-migration

Step-by-step migration to Spring Boot 4 + Java 25 (with Spring Modulith 2 and Testcontainers 2 support).

Scans your project first, then walks through dependencies → code → config in phases. Includes retry/resilience patterns and references for each upgrade target.

### code-reviewer

Sanity-checks your Boot 4 / Java 25 project for architecture fit and performance gotchas.

Covers all five architecture patterns (when to use, when to avoid), plus checklists for events, CQRS, Modulith boundaries. Catches N+1 queries, missing caches, virtual thread pinning, and other performance traps.

Use this when you want a second opinion or need to decide if it's time to evolve your architecture.

## Usage Examples

**"I need a REST API for products with basic CRUD."**
→ Asks about your domain, team, and timeline. Suggests Layered architecture. Generates scaffolding.

**"I need an order service with payments and inventory rules."**
→ Assesses complexity. Recommends Tomato architecture. Generates value objects, rich entities, CQRS services.

**"My product search is slow."**
→ Analyzes your queries, spots N+1 issues, refactors to DTO projections.

**"We need to migrate from Boot 3 to Boot 4."**
→ Runs migration scanner, plans phased upgrade (dependencies → code → config), applies and verifies each step.

**"Can you review our Boot 4 service for issues?"**
→ Checks architecture pattern fit, hunts for performance problems (N+1, missing caches, virtual thread pinning, entity leaks).

## Templates & Assets

**Architecture templates** (`creating-springboot-projects/assets/`)
Value Objects, Rich Entities, CQRS services, converters, REST controllers, Flyway migrations, Testcontainers, ProblemDetail handlers.

**JPA templates** (`spring-data-jpa/assets/`)
Query repositories, DTO projections, custom repos, CQRS query services, relationship patterns.

**Reviewer references** (`java25-springboot4-reviewer/references/`)
Architecture patterns, decision matrices, performance checklists.

**Reference guides** (`spring-data-jpa/references/`)
Query patterns, projections, custom repositories, relationship handling, performance tuning.

## Testing Skills

Want to verify skills work as intended? See the `tests/` directory for baseline scenarios.

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Run one scenario in 5 minutes
cd tests
cat QUICKSTART.md
```

**Full test suite:**
- 8 baseline scenarios testing each skill's core behaviors
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology
- Rationalization tracking
- See `tests/README.md` for complete testing guide

Based on [terraform-skill testing approach](https://github.com/antonbabenko/terraform-skill/blob/master/tests/baseline-scenarios.md).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI
- Java 25
- Maven or Gradle
- Spring Boot 4.0+ familiarity

## Evolution Path

Start simple, evolve as needed:

```text
Layered → Package-by-Module → Modular Monolith → Tomato → DDD+Hexagonal
```
